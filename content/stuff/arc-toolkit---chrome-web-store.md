Free accessibility testing tool from TPGi
The ARC Toolkit is a set of accessibility tools which aids developers in identifying accessibility problems and features for WCAG 2.0, WCAG 2.1, WCAG 2.2, EN 301 549, and Section 508.

The toolkit is designed to be integrated into automated and manual accessibility tests and works alongside the auditor or developer in order to simplify repetitive tasks and interactively explore accessibility features and problems.
